# Sythesthi

Part of [[Shards/Caemur|Caemur]]. Sythesthi struggles with poverty and often finds itself under the boot of [[Kingdoms/Caemur/Jonah|Jonah]] and [[Kingdoms/Caemur/Mago|Mago]].

**Capital:** [[Simit]]<br>
**Population:** Primarily [[Races/Humans|Humans]], [[Races/Elves|Elves]], [[Races/Orcs|Orcs]], and [[Races/Goblins|Goblins]]. Most other races have left in search of greener pastures.

## Geography
Sythesthi is craggy and barren, covered in sand, rocks, and mesas, with few natural water sources. Bushes and trees grow along the few rivers there are but the rest of the kingdom is all desert and mountains.

## Economy
Sythesthi is a struggling country, once proud. Recently the kingdom has fallen into near ruin, with all their crop fields drying up. The majority of the kingdom's fields were destroyed by the appearance of the [[World Scar]].

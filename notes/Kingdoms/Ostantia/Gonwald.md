# Gonwald

Part of [[Shards/Ostantia|Onstantia]]. Gonwald is the kingdom of [[Races/Halflings|Halflings]]. The kingdom is known for its celebrations and drinking.

**Capital:** [[Dorna]]
**Population:** Primarily [[Races/Halflings|Halflings]], [[Races/Dwarves|Dwarves]], and [[Races/Humans|Humans]], though other races can be found.

## Geography
Gonwald is made up of green forests and large mountains in the north.

## Economy
Gonwald's main export is beer and wine - the finest in on the continent - refined from the what and fruits exported by [[Kingdoms/Ostantia/Prismeen|Prismeen]]. Many places struggle to make ends meet, though, and the poor are often taxed heavily to pay for the expensive parties the kingdom is known for.

# Forgotten Isles

The forgotten Isles are a place made of more legend than fact, a collection of islands soaked in powerful magic. No one knows why these islands seem to possess an inherently arcane nature, but it has made them a very dangerous place. Over the many, many years since it appeared, the [[World Scar]] has become attracted by the powerful magical force that lies in these islands and has grown to cover them with its corruption. Some still hope that they might brave the wilderness and its terrifying beasts to discover the source of this placeâ€™s ancient power.

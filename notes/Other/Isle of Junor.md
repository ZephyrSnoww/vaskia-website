# Isle of Junor

The isle of Junor is located off the coast of [[Shards/Ostantia|Ostantia]], and is a place shrouded in mystery. It seldom receives visits from outsiders and when it does, strange stories almost always return. Inhabited and controlled by a purist cult, the people of Junor chose to isolate themselves from the world after the appearance of the [[World Scar]]. They have strict jurisdictions about who enter their borders and tend to remove themselves entirely from the politics of the continent.

**Capital:** [[Jenn Jenn]]<br>
**Population:** [[Races/Elves|Elves]] and [[Races/Humans|Humans]] are assumed, but little is actually known

## Geography
Junor is made up of beaches that lead into a large tropical forest.

# Isle of Castion

Home to the last Noble House of [[Harsta]], the first [[Races/Humans|human]] kingdom, the Isle of Castion is only a little ways off the coast of [[Shards/Caemur|Caemur]]. The traditions and practices found here stretch back thousands of years, even before the [[First Ones]] civilization. Harsta was once a great coalition of human kingdoms that dominated over the continent through conquest and bloodshed. Castion is the homeland of [[Harsta|the Harstians]] and they have never forgotten. Itâ€™s society is militaristic and bound by law, order, and tradition. The people of Castion dream of the day when they once again might take their rightful place on the throne of the world. The humans here are also extremely xenophobic, believing themselves to be the superior race above all others.

**Capital:** [[The First Seat of Harsta]]<br>
**Population:** Almost entirely [[Races/Humans|Humans]]

## Geography
Castion is comprised of rolling plains atop steep cliffs.

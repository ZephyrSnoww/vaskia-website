# Teli

The eastern shard of the continent. The population is ~90% [[Races/Elves|Elves]], and it was directly adjacent to the [[First Ones]] kingdom when the [[World Scar]] appeared. Rather than comprising of multiple countries, the elves split themselves along family bloodlines.

**Capital:** [[Kel'thanen]]<br>
**Population:** Almost entirely [[Races/Elves|Elves]]. All other races are uncommon.

## Geography
Teli is made up of deserts in the south, tall grass plains in the center, and thick forests - bordering on jungles - to the north.

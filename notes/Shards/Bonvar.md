# Bonvar

The western shard of the continent.

**Capitals:** [[Gunmari]], [[Thresh]], [[Gentri]], and [[Molark]]
**Population:** Mostly [[Races/Dwarves|Dwarves]] and [[Races/Humans|Humans]]. Other races can be found, albeit less commonly.

## Geography
Bonvar is made up of huge mountains covered in forests.

## Politics
The [[Races/Dwarves|Dwarves]] hold great value in their royal families. Because the shard is so close to [[Melakeep]], the dwarven kingdoms are highly independant. The kingdoms have a strong disdain for relying on others.

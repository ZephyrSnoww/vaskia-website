# Caemur

The south-eastern shard of the continent. Caemur is made up of the nations of [[Kingdoms/Caemur/Sythesthi|Sythesthi]], [[Kingdoms/Caemur/Jonah|Jonah]], and [[Kingdoms/Caemur/Mago|Mago]].

## Geography
Caemur is mostly desert.

## Politics
[[Kingdoms/Caemur/Sythesthi|Sythesthi]] finds itself under the boot of [[Kingdoms/Caemur/Jonah|Jonah]] and [[Kingdoms/Caemur/Mago|Mago]] very often. The government is struggling, and citizens are unruly and resentful of the oppression from the other two desert kingdoms.

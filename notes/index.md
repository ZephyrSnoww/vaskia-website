# Vaskia
 
Vaskia is a continent in the world of Drol'merr, destroyed by an ancient magical ritual. Long ago the [[First Ones]], an ancient utopian civilization with powerful magical technology, reigned supreme. The final king of this civilization was an extremely powerful magician, and he became consumed with expanding the boundaries of what magic could do. He focused on it over all else, ignoring caution, and after many, many years, his research finally gave results. He contrived a ritual that he believed would grant him untold amounts of power, and in his craving of this power, ignored the warning of his council and family and performed the ritual despite the danger it posed. It backfired, and the king tore the very reality of the world and its magical properties apart. Much was destroyed, turned into wastelands where boundaries between worlds blur and the laws of magic bend, flex, and break. These wastelands have come to be known as the [[World Scar]] by the survivors, and it spreads out from the center of Vaskia like a virus, creating impenetrable borders between nations.

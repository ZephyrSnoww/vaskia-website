# Elves

## Description
Elves are very magically inclined and are typically seen as the "graceful" race. They tend to be flexible, but elves have high regard for bloodlines and family. They tend to be exceptional at using the technology of the [[First Ones]], and build their cities into the land, rather than atop it. Elves are bipedal and don't have fur, though they can have long, flowing hair.

**Average height:** 5.2ft
**Average lifespan:** ~700yrs

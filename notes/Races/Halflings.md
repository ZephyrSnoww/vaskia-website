Halflings are a very short race, known especially for their large celebrations in [[Kingdoms/Ostantia/Gonwald|Gonwald]]. They tend to be cheerful, though this is most likely skewed by what they want others to see. [[Kingdoms/Ostantia/Gonwald|Gonwald]] is known for its poverty, and those lower on the economic ladder probably aren't as cheerful as everyone tends to think.

**Average height:** 3ft<br>

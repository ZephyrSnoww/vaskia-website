# Dwarves

## Description
Dwarves have a bipedal stance and though they may be small, they make up for what they lack in size with their hardiness. They tend to weight as much as the larger races, and are also relatively versatile, similar to [[Races/Humans|Humans]] in many ways. Dwarves have no fur, but tend to have more hair than [[Races/Humans|Humans]], which is usually braided in relatively simple designs.

**Average height:** 4.5ft
**Average lifespan:** ~400yrs

[[Madame D.]] asks [[Jace]] & [[Aidan]] to get stuff from [[Berts Bits & Bobs]] (to ask for "Cashews"), and they go and do so. [[Yuize]] walks into the shop with one half-orc and one full orc, also looking for some back room stuff. We all head into the back room, down a short stairwell and into the basement, and the gnome turns on the light. Theres some serious stuff here, still all over the place, but the stuff here looks like the [[First Ones]] technology. The orcs go and search through the stuff. Everyone looks around, though [[Jace]] has a bit of choice paralysis. [[Aidan]] finds a power core, though, and yoinks it. The leader(?) orc keeps getting mad at [[Yuize]] for bringing up the mission, and eventually [[Yuize]] sees something interesting on a workbench. The gnome explains that it broadcasts your thoughts when you put it on and [[Yuize]] politely declines. The leader orc wants to make her wear it because he thinks shes hiding something, but she successfully hides her thoughts. [[Jace]] wears it and his thoughts are all over the place, the gnome gives them their stuff and [[Yuize]] collects the crates, and they head out into the street to see a tavern brawl across the way.

[[Helen]] gets hit on by a drunk guy, heads into the bar and gets the house special which is massive. They try to get info from some (half?) orcs, fail, and join a game of poker. They don't cheat, but they win, and another player thinks they are, and a tavern brawl happens basically. They get tossed out of a window and the orcs they were talking to are trying to meet [[Yuize]]

[[Aria]] is working at an infirmary, helping someone who was clawed pretty badly. He's barely hanging on, hit by the world scar, and is probably going to die. She heads to the market.
